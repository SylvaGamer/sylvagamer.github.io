      <p>Hello! I go by Sylva, I make video games and Minecraft mods. I am still learning new things and building new projects. My dream is to be a semi-successful indie game designer! I hope I can make games and mods that everyone can enjoy.</p>
      <p>So far I have only a single published minecraft mod which you can check out down below, but I am working on getting many more projects published as I go to school for game design.</p>

      <h4>Colored Hex Blocks</h4>
      <p class="tag">Minecraft Mod</p>
      <p class="text_column">Colored Hex Blocks is a mod meant to solve the issue of their not being enough colors for flat blocks in Minecraft. So I decided to implement the dying process from leather armor and put it onto a custom modded flat block, adding stairs, slabs, walls, etc. I even went so far to give it glass and glass pane variants</p>
